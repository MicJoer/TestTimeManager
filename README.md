# TestTimeManager
The system is build of two components, located in the folder: App and Backend. The former is the UI, the latter is the backend connected to a local database that is included in the backend. So no need for installation.

To start the system, open 3 terminal windows. And run
1) cd app && npm start
2) cd backend && npm run build-watch
3) cd backend && npm start
